                    <p>The purpose of this project was to build data visualizations using Spotify's API. Users of the
                        website
                        would
                        input an artist they want recommendations for and a popularity level, then the artist's top 10
                        songs and
                        100
                        recommendations would be visualized on a variety of factors. This project would be accomplished
                        through
                        multiple steps.</p>

                    <p>Data is retrieved from an Azure API endpoint, subsequently parsed and structured for use in
                        website
                        visualization.</p>

                    <p>Note: This solution to gather data is not the most efficient, as it would be simpler to run the
                        app and
                        data
                        through Python. However, as this project is a learning exercise, we wanted to utilize our
                        knowledge of
                        SQL
                        databases.</p>

                    <p>First, data would be pulled from Spotify's API and uploaded to an SQLite server. Data would then

                        from
                        the SQLite server and passed through a Flask API to gather the data for the visualization

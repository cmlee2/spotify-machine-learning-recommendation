# Back to the Moon

In this activity, you'll use a deep learning model to classify the moons dataset.

## Instructions

* Upload the starter notebook to Google Colab, and then run the cells to recreate the moons dummy dataset.

* Create your Keras Sequential model and add **more than one** Dense hidden layer to create a deep learning model.

  * **Notes:**

  * Only your first Dense layer uses the *input_dim* parameter.

  * All of your hidden layers should use the "ReLU" activation function.

* Compile your model and train the deep learning model on at least 100 epochs.

* Evaluate the performance of your model by calculating the loss and predictive accuracy of the model on your test dataset.

## Bonus

If you have enough time, try recreating your deep learning model with a different set of hidden layers and neurons, and then evaluate the performance of your new model. Are you able to achieve 100% predictive accuracy?

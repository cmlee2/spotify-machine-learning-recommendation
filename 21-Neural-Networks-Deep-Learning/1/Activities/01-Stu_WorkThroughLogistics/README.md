# Work Through Logistics

In this activity, you'll use a logistic regression to categorize data from the `make_blobs` function from scikit-learn to create data.

## Instructions

* Use the starter code provided to create your `make_blobs` dataset from scikit-learn.

* Split your dataset into training and testing sets using scikit-learn's `train_test_split` module.

* Create a LogisticRegression instance from scikit-learn's `LogisticRegression` model.

## Hint

  * If you need a reminder on how to create a `LogisticRegression` model, review the [Scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html).

* Train your `LogisticRegression` model on the training dataset.

* Evaluate your trained `LogisticRegression` model using the `accuracy_score` metric from scikit-learn.
